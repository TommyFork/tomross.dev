My name is Tommy, a full-stack engineer and product builder based in Boston, MA 🇺🇸


I started coding in middle school, making Minecraft plugins for my friends. That pulled me into Java, then web development with PHP, and by [high school](https://archive.ph/oe9mp), I was deep into Node.js. Thankfully, I haven't touched Java or PHP since. 

Along the way, I've built everything from machine learning models to full stack web apps to a couple of failed startups. I started my last failed startup, [BrightBook](/work#brightbook), a platform to personalize lessons to individual student needs, while a junior in college.


I led the venture from idea to prototype to piloting in the Boston Public Schools. It was an amazing journey full of many failures and lessons that will stick with me for life.


I enjoy thinking about the future of software, AI, education, and finance. Lately I've been particularly interested in generative UI and personal AI financial advisors. I also love my dog, getting out in nature, and cooking for the people I love.


I graduated cum laude from Boston University's Questrom School of Business, where I concentrated in Business Analytics.
